In this repo:

- There is a Flask application with some features built out.
- There is a fully built React frontend application.

You can check your API by:

- Using Postman to make requests

- Running the React application in the browser and interacting with the API via
  the frontend

You can import `project-4-bookstore.postman_collection.json` into Postman by
pressing the `Import` button.

## Setup

To download the dependencies for the frontend and backend, run:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

## Models

The file `server/models.py` defines the model classes **without relationships**.
Use the following commands to create the initial database `app.db`:

```console
export FLASK_APP=server/app.py
flask db init
flask db upgrade head
```
You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

## Many-to-many

- Customer has many orders through books
- Orders has many customerss through books
- Books belong to orders, and a customer

## Validations 

Add validations to the `Books` model:

- must have a name

Add validations to the `Orders` model:

## Controllers

​​API routes RESTful conventions

```console
GET    /books/              
POST   /books/             
GET    /books/:id           
PATCH  /books/:id           
DELETE /books/:id
```          

```console
GET    /customer/             
POST   /customer/
```           

```console
GET    /orders/:id         
PATCH  /orders/:id         
DELETE /orders/:id
```

FRONTEND (REACT) Which components will make requests to your API? What route will the competent send fetch requests too? (i.e: ArtistForm, send a POST requests to /artists)
